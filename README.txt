Project 1.5

I packaged the project in this folder called RSS the source content should be in bin or src.
I tried turning my project into an executable to be run through the command line.
It is for sure runnable through the eclipse IDE though.

I tried using the IDE you recommended and although I do enjoy it, i finalized everything in Eclipse because
I was not very used to it. If my files don't work in any other IDE it will for sure work in Eclipse.

All of the api's that i looked at were either too outdated or just were too complex for me to use.
I tried the api you recommended from google but it isn't supported anymore. When I used it, it created
a java window that had no map information and only a red line stretching across the screen.
I built a workaround which opens a browser and displays the different cities where all the jobs are located
in using some url manipulation.  
Each of my job lists also contain the city name so the user will know where they would potentially be working.
This was the simplest and most effective workaround i could come up with. 
I also think its cool because the user gets to see the border of the entire city.

INCLUDED IN THIS ZIP are:
1. The project folder containing the source code and the unit test code
2. A screenshot showing the UNIT Test success
